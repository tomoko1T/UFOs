# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this analysis is to create a webpage of UFO sightings.  The users can find the UFO sightings based on the certain criteria they enter.  The process is to create a table to organize UFO data using JavaScript so that it reacts to user input by filtering the data.  The HTML file is built with Bootstrap is a window to show their selection.  The last stage of the analysis is to add a filter function so that the users can find the sightings by not only entering date but also entering other criterias such as city, state and country, and so on.

## Results: 

The new version of webpage allows the users to filter the data based on the criterias they input, city, state, country and shape in addition to date.  This function helps them to search any UFO sightings with not limited the date but also with more key information they have.

## Summary:  

The drawback of the webpage is there is not keyword search.  The user may have only information which is not related to the provided fields.
Two recommendations for further development are follows:
    - To add a keyword saerch field. 
    - To add a link to lead a corresponding articles for the sighting the user selects.  In this way, the webpage can provide them with more information and could intrigue the users.
